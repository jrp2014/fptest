# IEEE754 conformance tests for Haskell

This project contains floating point conformance tests in Haskell.

There are two sets of tests so far:

* **QTrial**, a floating pint benchmark described in *IEEE Standard 754 for Binary Floating-Point Arithmetic* by Prof. W. Kahan [Download link](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/~wkahan/ieee754status/IEEE754.PDF)

* **FPTest**, which runs a sequence of test vectors generated by IBM's [FPGen Floating-Point Test Generator](https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/projects/verification/fpgen/).

  This is done in two ways:

  * By interpreting the tests
  * By translating the tests into a Haskell Hnit test suite script that can just be run using runghc

  The IBM tests are contained in the `test_suite` directory, but you will want to get the latest version from the link above.

  You will, most likely, want the binary tests unless you have a decimal machine.  Only 32-bit float tests are provided (not 64-bit double ones).


  The syntax of the test vectors can be found [here](https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/projects/verification/fpgen/syntax.txt) or in Chapter 4 of [Floating-Point Test-Suite for IEEE](https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/projects/verification/fpgen/papers/ieee-test-suite-v2.pdf)

  The test suite that IBM supplies actually stretches the spec somewhat.  For example, it also uses lower case versions of some specification elements.
