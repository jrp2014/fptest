# IEEE754 tests in Haskell

Running the "Floating-Point Test-Suite  IEEE", IBM Labs in Haifa,
FPgen team. Contact: Merav Aharoni

The test file spec is set out in
https://www.research.ibm.com/haifa/projects/verification/fpgen/papers/ieee-test-suite-v2.pdf

The test suite that IBM supplies actually stretches the spec somewhat.
For example, it also uses lower case versions of some specification elements.
